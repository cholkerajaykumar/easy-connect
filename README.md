## Project Design

Front end of simply online is implemented using React.
WebRTC technology is used to add the video communication capabilities.
Backend is implemented using Node.js and database system we used is MySQL

## Funtional requirements of the Application

1.User Authentication: The application should allow users to create an account with a unique username and password. Users should be able to log in to the application using their credentials. Credentials should be stored in the database by encryption.<br/>

2.Creating and Joining Rooms: The application should allow users to create a room for their class. Users should be able to join existing rooms for their classes by entering a room name or link.<br/>

3.Video Calling: The application should enable video calling between users in the same room. Users should be able to mute and unmute their audio and video during the call.<br/>

4.Screen Sharing: The application should allow users to share their screens with other users in the same room. Users should be able to control which screen is being shared and who can see it.<br/>

5.Face Recognition and Attendance: The application should capture images of users' faces during the video call. The application should analyze these images using the Deep Face library to recognize users and mark their attendance. The application should provide the lecturer with a summary of attendance for each class.

### Front-end Design

The front-end of the SimplyOnline web application is designed using React JS, a popular framework for building single-page applications.

- **User Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear and concise layouts and color schemes.
- **Navigation:** The navigation system is designed to provide easy access to all the features of the application, with clearly labeled menus and icons.

### Back-end Design

The back-end of the SimplyOnline web application is designed using Node JS, a popular framework for building scalable and performant applications.

- **RESTful API:** The back-end provides a RESTful API for the front-end to communicate with the server.
- **Database Access:** The back-end interacts with the MySQL database system to store and retrieve data.

## File Structure

Our application is structured as follows:

| File Name        | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend          | This folder contains the database schema and dummy data.                                    |
| Client           | This folder contains the codes for Front End.                                               |
| Demo-Videos      | This folder contains the photos of each team member that are used on the project Wiki page. |
| Documents        | This folder contains all the Project Deliverable files featured on the project Wiki page.   |
| Face-recognition | This folder contains the codes for face recognition written in python.                      |
