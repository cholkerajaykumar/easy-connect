## Project Design

Front end of simply online is implemented using React.
WebRTC technology is used to add the video communication capabilities.
Backend is implemented using Node.js and database system we used is MySQL

## Funtional requirements of the Application

1.User Authentication: The application should allow users to create an account with a unique username and password. Users should be able to log in to the application using their credentials. Credentials should be stored in the database by encryption.<br/>

2.Creating and Joining Rooms: The application should allow users to create a room for their class. Users should be able to join existing rooms for their classes by entering a room name or link.<br/>

3.Video Calling: The application should enable video calling between users in the same room. Users should be able to mute and unmute their audio and video during the call.<br/>

4.Screen Sharing: The application should allow users to share their screens with other users in the same room. Users should be able to control which screen is being shared and who can see it.<br/>

5.Face Recognition and Attendance: The application should capture images of users' faces during the video call. The application should analyze these images using the Deep Face library to recognize users and mark their attendance. The application should provide the lecturer with a summary of attendance for each class.

### Front-end Design

The front-end of the SimplyOnline web application is designed using React JS, a popular framework for building single-page applications.

- **User Interface:** The user interface we designed is simple where user can createroom and join room for video calling


### Back-end Design

The back-end of the SimplyOnline web application is designed using Node JS, a popular framework for building scalable and performant applications.

- **RESTful API:** The back-end provides a RESTful API for the front-end to communicate with the server.
- **Database Access:** The back-end interacts with the MySQL database system to store and retrieve data.

## File Structure

Our application is structured as follows:

| File Name        | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend          | This folder contains the database schema and dummy data.                                    |
| Client           | This folder contains the codes for Front End.                                               |
| Demo-Videos      | This folder contains the photos of each team member that are used on the project Wiki page. |
| Documents        | This folder contains all the Project Deliverable files featured on the project Wiki page.   |
| Face-recognition | This folder contains the codes for face recognition written in python.                      |


## Technology Stack:

- Framework : React
- Backend : Express JS, Node JS
- Face-recognition: Deepface, Flask (Python libraries)
- Database : MySQL
- Version Control: Git
- Code Editor : Visual Studio Code

## WEbRTC
WebRTC is a free tool that allows people to talk or message 
each other in real-time using their web browsers or mobile apps. 
You can easily use it by following simple codes called APIs. 

Google made a new thing in 2011 that lots of people use for 
talking and working together on the internet. WebRTC lets 
people talk to each other online without needing extra programs 
or tools. It's an easy way to learn remotely. 
WebRTC lets people talk to each other quickly using some rules 
and tools like RTP, SIP, and ICE. These rules make sure that 
communication is safe, works well, and is fast, even when the 
network is not easy to use. WebRTC has tools that can make 
the sound and video better in communication. They can help to 
stop noise, echoes, and make sure the volume is good.

* First create and login into AgoraRTC account 

[AgoraRTC](https://www.agora.io/en/) 

* generate the APP_ID from the given documentation and copy to clipboard

## Running Backend Server:

* Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/htmw/SimplyOnline.git
```


* move to backend directory
```
cd backend/
```

* Make sure you have Node, mysql installed and correctly set up.
* Create a new database in MySQL using:
```
mysql -u root -p
```
Enter mysql password, then run:

* Download sql file given in the backend directory & Enter the following command and execute to create a database and its related tables required for the project
```
source sql.sql;
```

* open .env file in the current directory and replace the following database details with your own and save it.
```
MY_SQL_USER = "myuser"(replace)
PASSWORD = "mypassword"(replace)
DB = "mydb"(replace)

```

* Run the following command to install packages related to backend
  
```
npm install
```

 * Finally run the following command to run backend server 
```
node index.js
```

>Now you can see the connection is succeed and the server is listening on 


## Running Frontend Server:

* Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/htmw/SimplyOnline.git
```
* Install NodeJS LTS version from https://nodejs.org/en/ for your Operating System.
* Navigate to client folder and install required libraries:
```
cd client/
npm install
```
* In case of any error run audit and install once more:
```
npm audit fix --force && npm install
```

* open .env file in the current directory and replace the following database details with your own and save it.
```
APP_ID = "youragoraRTC-app_id"
BACKEND_URL = "backend-end running port"
```

* Run the following command to run the front-end(client):
```
npm start
```

>Now you can see the client running on localhost

## Running face-recognition server:

* Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/htmw/SimplyOnline.git
```
* Install python and pip from python.org
* Navigate to face-recognition folder and install required libraries:

```
cd face-recognition/
```

* in the Images folder add your images to train the module
```
cd images/
```

* Run the following command to install dependencies required

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run the following command to run face-recognition server
```
python home.py
```
